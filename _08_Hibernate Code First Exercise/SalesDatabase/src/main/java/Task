Your task is to design a database using the Code First
approach. The GP needs to keep information about his patients.
Each patient has first name, last name, address, email, date of birth,
picture, information whether he has medical insurance or not.
The GP should also keep history about all his visitations,
diagnoses and prescribed medicaments. Each visitation has date and
comments. Each diagnose has name and comments for it.
Each medicament has name. Make sure all data is validated
before inserting it in the database.
